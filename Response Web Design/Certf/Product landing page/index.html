<!-- Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks

User Stories:

//* Your product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header"
//* You can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img" (A logo would make a good image here)
//* Within the #header element, you can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar"
//* You can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link
* When you click a .nav-link button in the nav element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page
* You can watch an embedded product video with id="video"
* Your landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form"
* Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where you can enter an email address
* The #email input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for
* The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address
* Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit"
* When you click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit)
* The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport
* Your product landing page should have at least one media query
* Your product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once
* Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your own personal style. Happy Coding!
